# DipRush Financial App System Design

## Implementation approach

Based on the product requirements document, we'll implement a modern, responsive financial application for detecting market dips using a clean architecture approach. Here's our implementation strategy:

### Core Technologies

1. **Next.js with React**: We'll use Next.js as our React framework which provides built-in optimizations, routing, and server-side rendering capabilities when needed.

2. **TypeScript**: The entire application will be implemented using TypeScript for type safety and better developer experience.

3. **TailwindCSS**: For styling, we'll use TailwindCSS utility-first approach which will allow for rapid UI development and consistency.

4. **Finnhub API**: We'll integrate with Finnhub API for financial data, stock information, and possibly some technical indicators.

### Key Technical Challenges and Solutions

1. **Technical Indicator Calculation**:
   - For indicators available via Finnhub API (like RSI), we'll use the API directly
   - For complex calculations or indicators not available through Finnhub, we'll use a combination of custom implementations and open-source libraries like `technicalindicators` for client-side calculations

2. **Chart Rendering**:
   - We'll use Recharts for visualization as it's React-native, lightweight, and customizable
   - Chart.js with react-chartjs-2 will be our fallback option if we need more specialized financial charts

3. **State Management**:
   - React Context API for global state (API key, theme, language)
   - SWR for data fetching, caching, and state management of API data to minimize API calls

4. **API Key Security**:
   - Secure storage in browser using encrypted localStorage
   - Clear session option for shared devices

5. **Responsive UI**:
   - Mobile-first approach using Tailwind's responsive utilities
   - Component-based design for reusability across different viewport sizes

6. **Internationalization**:
   - next-i18next for language support (English/Chinese)
   - Separation of translation files for maintainability

7. **Performance Optimization**:
   - Code splitting and lazy loading for non-critical components
   - Memoization of expensive calculations for technical indicators
   - Efficient rendering strategies for large datasets in tables

## Data structures and interfaces

Detailed class diagrams, interfaces, and data structures will be provided in a separate mermaid diagram file.

## Program call flow

Detailed sequence diagrams showing component interactions will be provided in a separate mermaid diagram file.

## Anything UNCLEAR

1. **API Rate Limiting**: The PRD mentions API rate limiting as an open question. We'll implement a queue-based approach for API requests with exponential backoff for retries and appropriate user feedback mechanisms.

2. **Stock Universe Selection**: Since the PRD doesn't specify which stocks to include in screening, we'll provide a default set of major US market stocks (e.g., S&P 500) with the option for users to customize their watchlist in future versions.

3. **Data Refresh Rate**: We'll implement a configurable refresh rate with a default of 5 minutes between full refreshes to balance data freshness with API quota usage.

4. **Technical Indicator Parameter Customization**: For P1 requirement of customizable indicator parameters, we'll implement this as user preferences stored in localStorage.
